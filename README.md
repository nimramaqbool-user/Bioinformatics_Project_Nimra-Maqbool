SUMMARY- The given sequence corresponds to the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a highly conserved ATP-regulated chloride channel. Its well-defined structural and regulatory domains enable controlled ion transport, which is essential for maintaining epithelial fluid balance and normal lung and pancreatic function.
TOOLS USED- NCBI, blastn, ORF FINDER, EXPASY, RNAFOLD, PSORT, DeepLoc, InterPro, ProtParam, Pfam, COBALT, STRING.
ACKNOWLEDGMENT- I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Prof. Dr. SAMINA SHAKEEL for her valuable guidance, encouragement, and continuous support throughout this project. I also gratefully acknowledge the online databases and bioinformatics tools that made this study possible.
