Final predicted location:Endoplasmic reticulum (ER).

Justification:
DEEPLOC identifies a signal peptide and transmembrane domain, with high probabilities for ER-related compartments (ER, Golgi, lysosome/vacuole). 
PSORT shows the strongest prediction for the endoplasmic reticulum (55.6%), with weaker support for vacuolar and Golgi locations. 
This evidence collectively supports ER localization and potential trafficking through the secretory pathway.
