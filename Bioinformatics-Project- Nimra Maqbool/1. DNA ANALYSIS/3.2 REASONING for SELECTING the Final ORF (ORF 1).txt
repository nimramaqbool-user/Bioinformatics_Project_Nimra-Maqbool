ORF analysis was performed using the NCBI Open Reading Frame (ORF) Finder. The analysis identified two ORFs within the ~2.59 kb nucleotide sequence. Among these, ORF1 was selected as the most probable protein-coding region.
ORF1 spans the majority of the sequence (approximately 1.26 kb), making it the longest ORF detected. It contains a clear ATG start codon, a proper in-frame stop codon, and remains continuous without internal stop codons, indicating a stable reading frame. The length, continuity, and completeness of ORF1 strongly suggest that it represents a functional gene, as genuine protein-coding regions are typically long and uninterrupted.
In contrast, the remaining ORF (ORF2) is considerably shorter and located near the terminal region of the sequence, which increases the likelihood that it arose by chance in a non-coding region rather than encoding a functional protein. 
Therefore, based on established criteria—maximum length, full coverage of the sequence, presence of valid start and stop codons, and a single continuous reading frame—ORF1 was selected for downstream protein translation and functional analysis.
