The BLAST analysis was performed using a raw DNA sequence as the query to identify its corresponding gene and species. The search returned three top hits. 
The first hit corresponds to Homo sapiens CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator) mRNA, which encodes an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter protein that functions as a chloride ion channel in epithelial cell membranes. This hit displayed 100% query coverage and 100% sequence identity with an E-value of 0.0, indicating a perfect nucleotide-by-nucleotide match and a highly significant alignment. 
The second hit also represents a human CFTR transcript but shows minor sequence differences (~99.88% identity), likely due to transcript variants or sequencing updates.
The third hit corresponds to CFTR mRNA from Pan troglodytes (chimpanzee), showing high sequence conservation (~99.73% identity) but from a different species.
The first hit was selected as the best match solely based on alignment metrics—complete coverage, perfect identity, and lowest E-value. These results confirm that the raw DNA sequence corresponds to the human CFTR gene, providing a reliable reference for further functional and comparative analyses.
