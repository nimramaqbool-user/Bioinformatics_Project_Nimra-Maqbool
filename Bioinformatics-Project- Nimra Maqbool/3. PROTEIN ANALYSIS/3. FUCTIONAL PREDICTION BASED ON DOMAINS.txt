
Based on the InterProScan results, the CFTR can be functionally predicted as follows:

• Transmembrane Domains (TMDs) – ABC Transporter Type 1
Multiple membrane-spanning helices form a pore for ions, indicating that the protein is membrane-localized and capable of ion transport.

• CFTR Regulatory Domain (CFTR_R)
Unique to CFTR among ABC transporters, this domain enables phosphorylation-dependent regulation, suggesting that channel activity is controlled by cellular signaling.

• Nucleotide-Binding Domains (NBD / P-loop)
These domains bind and hydrolyze ATP, providing the energy required to open and close the channel (gating mechanism).

• AAA+ ATPase Domain
Supports ATP-driven conformational changes, enhancing energy-dependent regulation of channel function.

SUMMARY
CFTR is a membrane-localized ABC transporter with multiple transmembrane helices forming an ion-conducting pore. 
Its unique regulatory domain allows phosphorylation-dependent control, while nucleotide-binding and AAA+ ATPase domains provide ATP-driven gating and conformational regulation.
