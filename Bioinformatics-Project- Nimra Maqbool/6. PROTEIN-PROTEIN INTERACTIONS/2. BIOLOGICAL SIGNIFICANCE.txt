CFTR acts as a central hub interacting with multiple proteins that control its folding, degradation, activation, and localization. 

1.Folding & Quality Control:
Chaperones like Hsc70 (HSPA8), Hsp90 (HSP90AA1), and CHIP (STUB1) assist proper folding and prevent misfolded CFTR accumulation.
Misfolding leads to cystic fibrosis pathology.

2.Degradation & Ubiquitination:
E3 ligases (RNF5, STUB1) tag defective CFTR for proteasomal degradation, controlling protein levels.
Excess degradation reduces functional CFTR at the membrane.

3.Regulation by PKA:
PKA subunits phosphorylate CFTR’s regulatory domain, activating chloride transport.

4.Trafficking & Membrane Localization:
Scaffold proteins (GOPC, NHERF1/2) anchor CFTR to the apical membrane, coordinating ion transport.
CFTR function requires precise folding, controlled degradation, activation, and proper membrane targeting. Disruption of any of these interactions can contribute to cystic fibrosis, even beyond CFTR gene mutations.
